HOW TO USE THE PRODUCTIVITY ANALYZER
------------------------------------

1) START THE SERVER
Run:
    uvicorn app:app --reload

Then open:
    http://127.0.0.1:8000


2) MANUAL ANALYSIS (UPLOAD MODE)
- Click the upload box
- Add 2 or more screenshots
- Click ANALYZE
- System will:
    · Compare screenshots
    · Detect inactivity
    · Show verdict + scores


3) TIME-BASED ANALYSIS (RANGE MODE)
- Run auto_capture.py (saves screenshots automatically)
- Click:
    · Past 30 mins
    · Past 1 hour
    · Past 2 hours
- System will fetch all screenshots from that time range
- Compares every pair → gives final verdict


4) CLEAR BUTTON
Clears the preview images and resets all metrics.


5) OUTPUT
You will see:
    - Verdict
    - Similarity percentage
    - Suspicion score
    - Productivity score


6) FOLDER USAGE
uploads/       → manually uploaded screenshots  
auto_screens/  → auto captured screenshots  


7) TROUBLESHOOTING
- If no verdict appears:
    · Ensure at least 2 images are uploaded
- If range mode says "Not enough screenshots":
    · Auto-capture may not be running
- If slow:
    · System caches processed images automatically


8) DONE!
Your productivity analysis system is ready to use.
